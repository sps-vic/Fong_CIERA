    "The code below is to be used for semi-automatically identifying emission features in a given spectra by taking advantage of the fact that while the locations of lines change with redshift, the ratios between line positions are redshift-invariant. The ratios of all possible line pairs in an input calibration list are compared  with the ratios of all possible pairs of observed liness, and matches are suggested if a pair of observed wavelengths has a ratio within a user-specified error of a calibration pair. The suggested identifications for these pairs are then printed out, and their redshifts (and averaged redshfit estimate with uncertainty) can also be printed out if desired. Any additions, changes, or improvements to the code below are more than welcome!\n",
